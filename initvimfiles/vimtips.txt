"[[Windows]]
"- :windo makes all windows do the same command.
"- <c-w><c-w> goes to the next window, while <c-w><c-p> goes to the last window.
"- <c-w>+j,h,k,l works.

"[[Registry]]
"- Look up the register file by :reg.
"- Paste from registry by using "<char>p.
"- Copy to registry by using "<char>y (visual select might be useful).

"[[Case]]
"- Change the case of a letter by [visual_mode] + (u,U,~).

"[[Tags]]
"- ctags should be updates using command: $ ctags -R .

"[[Recovery]]
"- If .swp file was created, you can recover that file by $vim -r <filename> Or, just press R and it sometimes works. Save the file with different name (or backup the original file with different name and then recover).

"[[Difference]]
"- $ vimdiff filename1 filename2 << this is a helpful tool.
"- For neovim, it is nvim -d filename1 filename2.
"- c[,c] to just to difference chunks
"- do (diff obtain), dp (diff put) to equalize the differences.
"- If you want to undo your do/dp, you can just simply <c-w><c-w>u. 

"[[Cursor]]
"- g; will bring your cursor to the previous changelist.
"- g, will bring you cursor to the next changelist.
"- `` (two backticks) will bring you to the last location of the cursor.
"- TODO: figure out the actual mechanism of ``
"- * will move your cursor to the next word. eg) myvar -> myvar
"- g* will move your cursor to the next text. eg) myvar -> heymyvar3
"- gf will open the file under the cursor.
"- <c-w>f will open the file in a new window.
"- <c-w>gf will open the file in a new tab.

"[[Substitute]]
"- :%s/\s\+$// << Delete all spaces and tabs at the end of my lines

":sort
":sort i "ignorecase
":sort! "reverse sort
":sort /{pattern}/ "skip pattern
":sort r /{pattern}/ "search for pattern

"[[.vimrc tips]]
"- You can change the plugin variable within vim command mode by just typing :let g:something_blah=foo
